**Utility to convert json to an Excel file.**

This is an updated version of [json2xls](https://github.com/rikkertkoppes/json2xls) which seems to be abandoned, and have some important vulnerabilities in its dependencies (some of them abandoned too).

This project is based in:
- [`json2xls`](https://github.com/rikkertkoppes/json2xls), by [Rikkert Koppes](https://github.com/rikkertkoppes).
- [`excel-export`](https://github.com/functionscope/Node-Excel-Export), by [functionscope](https://github.com/functionscope).

None of those projects included any kind of license, I'm distributing this new version with the MIT license.

## Installation

`npm i json-xls-converter`
